* Awesome Open Assets

AOA is a repo with links to amazing places on the internet where you can get assets for your creative projects. These assets have been identified to have open licenses and are free to use. Some of these may seem like an odd inclusion at first, but, I do "cutout/collage" style art and animation, so maybe that will explain it. 


Please note that not all of these are in the public domain. While many are, there may be other types of licenses these places follow, such as [[https://creativecommons.org/]]. So, be a little vigilant. Enjoy!
